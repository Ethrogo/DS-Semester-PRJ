An observation in this study is an NBA game,represented by the data associated 
with the two teams playing in that game

This is a supervised learning problem, specifically a regression task. 
The target variable is the point spread: the predicted difference in score 
between the home and away team.

Target (y): Spread (home_points - away_points).
Predictors (X): A combination of team-level stats, player contributions, 
and game-specific variables.

The analysis will start with linear regression as a baseline model to 
establish interpretable relationships between features and the spread. 
Linear regression will help identify initial trends and highlight key 
predictors in a straightforward way. Following this, random forest 
regression will be used to account for non-linear relationships and
feature interactions that linear models may miss. To further refine
predictions, gradient boosting methods like XGBoost will be applied
to iteratively minimize residual errors by building upon previous
 predictions.

Feature engineering will be critical for extracting meaningful predictors 
from the raw data. To capture recent team performance, rolling averages 
will be calculated for key metrics like points scored, rebounds, and 
shooting percentages over the last 5 games. Aggregation techniques will 
summarize player-level data into team-level metrics for each game, ensuring 
a balance between granularity and interpretability. Categorical features 
like team names and home/away status will be one-hot encoded to incorporate 
these variables into the models. To handle the high-dimensional nature of 
the dataset, feature selection techniques like LASSO or dimensionality 
reduction using PCA will be applied.
